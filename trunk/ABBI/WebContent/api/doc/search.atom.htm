<h1>Search Results Output</h1>
<p>Search results generated by this application can be produced in a variety of
formats as specified by:</p>

<ul>
 <li>IHE's <a
     href="http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_MHD.pdf">Mobile
     Access to Health Documents</a> Profile</li>
 <li>HL7's Fast Health Information Resources <a
     href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/fhir-book.htm#documentheader">DocumentHeader Resource</a></li>
 <li>ABBI's Atom Format</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these formats uses the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom
Syndication Format</a> to wrap the response.</p>

<h2>ABBI Feeds </h2>

<p>An ABBI feed starts with a top level &lt;feed&gt; tag in
application/atom+xml format. The &lt;feed&gt; element will contain
the following elements:</p>

<h3>&lt;id&gt;</h3>

<p>This must be a unique id for the feed for the patient. The feed for the demonstration
application provides the base URL for the search API call which generated this
feed, and includes the patientId query parameters in
the URL to differentiate between multiple feeds from the same site for
different patients. No other query
parameters will be included in the URL. The value of patientId query parameter will be
URL encoded.</p>

<h3>&lt;generator&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed will contain a &lt;generator&gt; element describing the application
used to generate the content. The
URI attribute should point to a web site describing where the content generator
is described. The version attribute
should be present to indicate what version of the application was used to
generate the content. The text of
this element should provide a short text description of the generator.</p>

<h3>&lt;link&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed will have at least one link[@rel="self"] containing information about the
API call that generated the content. That link contains the full URL of the search API call which produced
the content in the href attribute. The rel attribute will be equal to self. No
other &lt;link&gt; element may be present with rel="self", but other links may be present.</p>

<h3>&lt;icon&gt;</h3>
<p>The feed may provide an icon. Feeds generated by the demonstration
application will generate a URL to <a href="../../images/icon.jpg">this</a> icon image.  See the <a href="../../credits.jsp">credits</a> page for more details on this image.</p>

<h3>&lt;logo&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed may provide a logo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Feeds generated by the demonstration
application will generate a URL to <a href="../../images/logo.jpg">this</a> logo image.  See the <a href="../../credits.jsp">credits</a> page for more details on this image.</p>

<h3>&lt;rights&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed should provide text describing application rights and restrictions
on the content as agreed to and authorized by the patient or their authorized
representative. An example of what
might appear can be found below.</p>

<p class=MsoQuote>Content in this feed is provided by (Sending Organization) to
receiving applications as authorized by the patient or authorized
representative. The information
contained herein may contain sensitive patient information, individually
identifiable data or other protected health information, and <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>should be protected by adequate
security mechanism. The provider of
this service communicates this information securely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Responsibility for securing this information
after it has been delivered through this service is left to the receiving application,
and/or the patient or their authorized representative.</p>

<h3>&lt;contributor&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed may describe contributors (e.g., organizations that
provided content) to content in the feed.</p>

<h3>&lt;title&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed will provide a title describing the content in
general terms. The title should indicate
who this information pertains to.</p>

<h3>&lt;subtitle&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed may provide a subtitle describing the content in
more detail. The sample application
describes the content in terms of what was queried.</p>

<h3>&lt;category&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed should report the categories associated with the
search query terms used to generate the content (e.g., format, class and <span
class=SpellE>mimeType</span>).</p>

<h3>&lt;updated&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed will provide the date which the content is
generated in the &lt;updated&gt; tag. </p>

<h3>&lt;author&gt;</h3>

<p>The feed SHOULD NOT usually contain &lt;author&gt; elements.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Each document in the feed must have an
individually identified author.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Feeds which generate content from a single author (e.g., patient
generated content) may include an &lt;author&gt; element, but &lt;author&gt;
elements must be present on each document.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>The demonstration application does not generate &lt;author&gt; elements
in feeds.</p>
